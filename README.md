ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris.  
Iâ€™m a molecular biologist turning full stack developer.   
I'm currently working with TypeScript, React, Nodejs.  
I'm currently learning sveltekit.


## Update June '23:

### I have completed:
1. [codeacademy's full stack engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-cozens-b2883a45_im-happy-to-share-that-ive-obtained-a-new-activity-7032076507715915776-Mvna?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) pathway
2. [MS Learn TypeScript intro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/).
3. Rebuilding my first JS/react app ([live site](https://creative-cocada-575991.netlify.app/), [repo](https://github.com/ccozens/mol-bio-tools)) into TypeScript ([live site]([https://creative-cocada-575991.netlify.app/](https://courageous-otter.netlify.app/)), [repo](https://github.com/ccozens/astro-mol-bio-tools))
4. Built a full stack web app in TS/nextjs with prisma/supabase ([live site](https://www.weeklyevents.info/), [repo](https://github.com/ccozens/weekly_events)).
   
### Next up: sveltekit!
--> why? I learnt the nextjs pages router just before they introduced the app router. Faced with relearning it, I decided to learn sveltekit instead, so I could focus more on embedding my HTML, CSS and TS before going back to adding React to the mix.

#### How:
1. [Official svelte+kit tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte)
2. [Level Up sveltekit](https://levelup.video/tutorials/sveltekit)
2. [Level Up svelte+TypeScript]([https://levelup.video/tutorials/sveltekit](https://levelup.video/tutorials/svelte-and-typescript))

#### Then:
1. Build a blog with [MDX support](https://mdsvex.com/) and tags so I can document my future learning.
2. Experience! Open source and volunteer web dev projects.
