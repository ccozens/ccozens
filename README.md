ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris.  
Iâ€™m a molecular biologist turning full stack developer.   
I'm currently working with TypeScript, React, Nodejs, Python.  

Update late Feb'22:

I've completed [codeacademy's full stack engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-cozens-b2883a45_im-happy-to-share-that-ive-obtained-a-new-activity-7032076507715915776-Mvna?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) pathway, and currently I am:
1. Learning TypeScript at [MS Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/).
2. Improving my JavaScript with [JavaScript30](www.javascript30.com).
3. Building a profile site [Astro](https://astro.build/) / TypeScript / React.
4. Practicing HTML, CSS, JS with [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io).

And once I've progressed with some of that I will:
1. Refactor my first [JS/react app](https://creative-cocada-575991.netlify.app/) into TypeScript. More likely a complete rewrite from CRA -> Vite/Astro.
2. Contribute to [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/) - excited to see something I use and really like built in a language I want to work in (TypeScript) and which also allows to work in Python at the same time.
