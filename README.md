ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris.  
Iâ€™m a molecular biologist turning full stack developer.   
I'm currently working with TypeScript, React, Nodejs, Python.  

Update mid March'23:

I have completed:
1. [codeacademy's full stack engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-cozens-b2883a45_im-happy-to-share-that-ive-obtained-a-new-activity-7032076507715915776-Mvna?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) pathway
2. [MS Learn TypeScript intro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/).
3. Rebuilding my first JS/react app ([live site](https://creative-cocada-575991.netlify.app/), [repo](https://github.com/ccozens/mol-bio-tools)) into TypeScript ([live site]([https://creative-cocada-575991.netlify.app/](https://courageous-otter.netlify.app/)), [repo](https://github.com/ccozens/astro-mol-bio-tools))

Next up: back to Python!
Its some time since I've coded in Python, and I'm keen to get back to it. I'm planning some data analysis and some web dev:
1. analysis my personal activity (Fitbit) and/or energy consumption data in Jupyter
2. build a full stack web app of local activities for toddlers with SQL/PostgreSQL x Django backend and React x Typescript frontend.
